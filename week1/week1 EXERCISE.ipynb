       "### Explanation\n",
       "1. **Importing the Module**: We import the `ollama` module which contains the `chat` function.\n",
       "2. **Function Definition**: The `get_llama_response` function takes a question as input and uses the `ollama.chat` to get a response.\n",
       "3. **Infinite Loop**: A `while True` loop is set up, which continuously asks the user for input.\n",
       "4. **User Input**: The `input()` function is used to get the user's question.\n",
       "5. **Getting Response**: The function `get_llama_response()` is called with the user's question to get the response from Llama.\n",
       "6. **Printing the Response**: The response is printed out.\n",
       "7. **Handling Quit**: The loop will continue until the user presses `Ctrl+C`, at which point a message will be printed, and the program will exit gracefully.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Running the Code\n",
       "- Copy and paste the code into a cell in your Jupyter Notebook and run it.\n",
       "- You will be prompted to enter a question, and the Llama's response will be shown.\n",
       "- You can exit by pressing `Ctrl+C`.\n",
       "\n",
       "This setup is user-friendly and allows anyone, even novices, to ask questions and receive answers using the `ollama.chat` functionality. Enjoy chatting with Llama!"

       "**Breaking Down the Code**\n",
       "==========================\n",
       "\n",
       "The given code snippet is written in Python and utilizes a feature called **generators**. A generator is a special type of iterable that can be used to generate a sequence of results on-the-fly, rather than computing them all at once and storing them in memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "**Parts Explained**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **`yield from`**: This is a Python 3.3+ feature that allows us to delegate to another generator or iterable and have its results yielded by our own generator.\n",
       "2. **`{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}`**: This part is called a **generator expression**. It's similar to a list comprehension, but instead of building up a list, it generates values on-the-fly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's break down the `if` condition: `books` is assumed to be an iterable (like a list or dictionary). The generator expression iterates over each book in `books`. For each book, it checks if the book has an `\"author\"` key using the `.get()` method. If the key exists and its value is not empty (`\"\"`), the author's name is yielded.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Putting It All Together**\n",
       "---------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "The `yield from` statement takes the generator expression `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` and yields each of its values, one at a time. This allows us to process all authors without having to store them all in memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, this code is equivalent to:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "for author in {book[\"author\"] for book in books if \"author\" in book and book[\"author\"] != \"\"}:\n",
       "    yield author\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the generator expression version is more concise and efficient, especially when working with large datasets."
